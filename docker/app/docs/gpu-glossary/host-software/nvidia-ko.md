title: What is nvidia.ko?
---

`nvidia.ko` is a binary
[kernel module](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module) file at the core
of the [NVIDIA GPU drivers](/host-software/nvidia-gpu-drivers) for
Linux.

Like other kernel modules, it executes in privileged mode and communicates
directly with hardware on behalf of the user -- in this case, the GPU.

The Linux Open GPU Kernel Module is
[open source](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules).
