abbreviation: TPC
---

Generally synonymous with "pair of
[Streaming Multiprocessors](/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor)".
Rarely encountered in contemporary discussions of GPUs and not mapped onto a
level of the
[CUDA programming model](/device-software/cuda-programming-model)'s
[memory hierarchy](/device-software/memory-hierarchy) or
[thread hierarchy](/device-software/thread-block), unlike
[Graphics/GPU Processing Clusters](/device-hardware/graphics-processing-cluster).
