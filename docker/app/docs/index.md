# Nemotron Chat Application Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Nemotron Chat Application - a production-ready conversational AI platform with multimodal capabilities. Powered by the [NVIDIA Nemotron family of models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/nemotron/).

## What Is NVIDIA Nemotron?

The NVIDIA Nemotron‚Ñ¢ family of [multimodal models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models) provides state-of-the-art agentic reasoning for graduate-level scientific reasoning, advanced math, coding, instruction following, tool calling, and visual reasoning.

The models are optimized for different computing platforms: Nano for cost-efficiency and edge deployment, Super for balanced accuracy and compute efficiency on a single GPU, and Ultra for maximum accuracy in data centers.

The Nemotron models are commercially viable with an open license that allows for customization and data control.
