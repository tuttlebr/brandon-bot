# PDF Analysis Guide

The Streamlit Chat Application provides powerful PDF document analysis capabilities powered by AI.

## Uploading PDFs

### How to Upload

1. Look for the **PDF Upload** section in the sidebar
2. Click "Choose PDF file"
3. Select your PDF document (max 200MB by default)
4. Wait for processing to complete

### Supported Features

- Text extraction from all pages
- Intelligent content analysis
- Query-based information retrieval
- Multi-page document handling

## Analysis Strategies

The system automatically selects the best strategy based on document size:

### Small Documents (â‰¤5 pages)
- Instant full analysis
- All content processed at once
- Fastest response times

### Medium Documents (6-50 pages)
- Standard processing approach
- Full document loaded into memory
- Efficient for most use cases

### Large Documents (>50 pages)
- **Automatic Batch Processing** (NEW)
- Document split into 20-page batches
- Memory-efficient storage and retrieval
- Smart context loading based on your queries
- Only relevant pages loaded when needed

#### How Batch Processing Works

When you upload a PDF with more than 50 pages:

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system recognizes large documents and enables batch processing
2. **Intelligent Splitting**: The PDF is divided into manageable 20-page chunks
3. **Efficient Storage**: Each batch is stored separately to minimize memory usage
4. **Smart Loading**: When you ask questions, only relevant pages are loaded into context

#### Benefits of Batch Processing

- **No Memory Overload**: Large PDFs won't cause system crashes
- **Faster Processing**: Initial upload completes quicker
- **Targeted Analysis**: The system loads only what's needed for your question
- **Scalability**: Handle documents with hundreds or thousands of pages

#### Working with Batch-Processed PDFs

For best results with large documents:

1. **Specify Page Ranges**: Mention specific pages in your queries
   - "What does page 125 say about financial projections?"
   - "Summarize pages 50-75"

2. **Use Targeted Questions**: Be specific about what you're looking for
   - "Find information about risk management in the document"
   - "What are the conclusions in the final chapter?"

3. **Request Summaries**: The system will intelligently summarize available content
   - "Summarize this document" will process the first several batches
   - You'll be notified about which pages were included

## Example Queries

Once your PDF is uploaded, try these types of questions:

### Summary Requests
- "Summarize this document"
- "What are the key points?"
- "Give me the main takeaways"

### Specific Information
- "What does the document say about [topic]?"
- "Find all mentions of [keyword]"
- "Extract all dates mentioned"

### Analysis Tasks
- "What are the conclusions?"
- "Identify any risks mentioned"
- "List all recommendations"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "tell me about this PDF", ask "what are the financial projections in this document?"

2. **Use Context**: Reference specific sections: "In the methodology section, what research methods were used?"

3. **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on previous answers for deeper analysis

## Progress Tracking

For large documents, you'll see:
- Progress percentage
- Current processing phase
- Estimated time remaining
- Status messages

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Won't Upload
- Check file size (default limit: 200MB)
- Ensure PDF is not corrupted
- Try a different PDF first

### Slow Processing
- Large documents take more time
- Complex PDFs with images may process slower
- Check system resources

### Inaccurate Results
- Ensure PDF has selectable text (not scanned images)
- Be more specific in your queries
- Try breaking complex questions into parts

## Advanced Features

### Multiple PDFs
